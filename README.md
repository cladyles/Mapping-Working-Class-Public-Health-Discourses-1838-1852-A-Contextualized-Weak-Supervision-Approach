# Mapping-Working-Class-Public-Health-Discourses-1838-1852-A-Staged_Contextualized_Weak_Supervision_Approach
### **Environment and Code Explanation**

As all task requires a GPU for accelerated computation, all code was developed and executed on the Google Colab platform.
Ordered Code will be updated into this resposity soon.

You can view the complete code for this project at the following link:

### **Important: Data Preparation Steps**

Before running the code, you must access the required dataset via the link below. The code is configured to read data from this shared folder.

* **Google Drive Data Link**: `[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CTOI1HrzjR17xax_MysQJyWnl0WR2QoW?usp=drive_link]`

### **Instructions for Use**

To allow the Colab notebook to successfully access the shared files, please follow these three steps carefully:

1.  **Click the Google Drive data link** above to open the shared folder.
2.  In the page that opens, right-click on the folder and select **"Add shortcut to Drive"**. This will place a shortcut to the shared folder in the root directory of your own "My Drive".
3.  In the Colab notebook, run the code cell to mount Google Drive (i.e., `drive.mount(...)`) and authorize it using **your own** Google account.

Once this is done, the code will be able to access the required data files via the shortcut in your Drive, ensuring that the program runs smoothly in your environment.
